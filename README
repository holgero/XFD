h1. eXtreme Fedback Device

The aim is to bring the feedback from the continous integration build
faster to the developer.
For this a microcontroller (PIC18Fxx5x) controls some indicators (typically 
three LEDs mimicing a traffic light). The host runs a java program that
polls the CI build server and tells the microcontroller via usb which
LED(s) to light.

The device has its own official USB address (0x1d50:0x6039), thanks
to Openmoko Inc. (see
http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/USB_Product_IDs#USB_Vendor_and_Product_IDs ).

h2. Building

To build: Run make in the top level directory as this:
$ make

Needs to compile: make, gcc++, javac, maven, gputils
Needs at runtime: java, usblib (on linux), HID.DLL (on windows).

You will find the firmware under device/XFD.hex, flash your PIC with it.

The program for your host will be a jar file under buildmonitor/target
named buildmonitor-*-jar-with-dependencies.jar. Start it with a command
line like this:

$ java -jar buildmonitor-*-jar-with-dependencies.jar http://jenkins.my.domain:8080/view/BuildViewToWatch

Note: On Windows (before Windows 8) you need to install the WinUSB driver
for generic USB devices once before you can use it. You can use Zadig
(https://github.com/pbatard/libwdi/wiki/Zadig) for that purpose.

Branches:
master:		main branch, uses PIC18F13K50
18f2550:	a secondary branch, based on PIC18F2550, mostly for reference
		and for sentimental reasons (I started in this branch).
hid		a different approach to access the device on windows:
		it is declared as a HID and accessed with the HID.DLL
